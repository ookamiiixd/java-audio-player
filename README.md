---

[[English](README.md)] [[Bahasa Indonesia](README_ID.md)]

This is a bare minimum app, so there's no wide support of audio formats and there might be a bug

## Requirements

- A Java Runtime installed on your device
- Path to your Java runtime set on either `JAVA_HOME` or `PATH` environment variable if you want to use the `.exe` executable

You need Maven tool for the building step. If you want to skip build step, you can use the pre-built executable from the release page

## Building

- Clone this repo
  `git clone https://github.com/ookamiiixd/java-audio-player.git`
- Install and build
  `mvn install`

## Executing

Simply run the generated `.exe` executable, or run the jar using `java -jar "target/audio-player-1.0.0.0.jar"`

You can try with the sample sound in `samples/` directory
